  h2 What is MEAN Against Humanity?
  #home-wrapper
    p MEAN Against Humanity is a digital clone of Cards Against Humanity, built on the MEAN stack.
    p Cards Against Humanity is a party game for horrible people. Unlike most of the party games you've played before, Cards Against Humanity is as despicable and awkward as you and your friends.
    p The game is simple. Each round, one player asks a question from a black card, and everyone else answers with their funniest white card.
